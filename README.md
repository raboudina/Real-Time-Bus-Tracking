# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking

## Project description:
- This project is an exercise on rendering a map on a webpage using the MAPBOX library, and working with the DOM to add animation to the maps. 
- In this activity, we used the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. 
- We then added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.


## How to run:
Click on the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button and watch the marker moving on the map from MIT to Harvard passing through all the bus stops in between.

## Roadmap:
- For future work, we can let the user select any two locations on the map, and ask to display the stops between them.
